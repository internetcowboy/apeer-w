				<p class="lead text-left">Updated September 14, 2016</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern the access and use of the Apeer application (“App” or “Licensed Application”), communications and agreements created therein, products, services, and websites (collectively, “Services”) offered by Apeer, Inc. (“Apeer”).</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">Apeer offers a platform that connects attorneys seeking coverage on court appearances (“Principals”) with available appearance attorneys (“Peers”). Principals and Peers (collectively, “Members”) are independent attorneys in good standing with their respective state bar who are registered with Apeer. Members are able to assign court appearances to Peers. Peers meet certain professional requirements and may therefore review and accept appearances for which they are qualified.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">APEER IS NOT A LAW FIRM OR LAWYER REFERRAL SERVICE AND DOES NOT PRACTICE LAW, PROVIDE LEGAL ADVICE, OR MAKE APPEARANCES IN COURT.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">MEMBERS WHO REQUEST, ACCEPT, AND PROVIDE SERVICES THROUGH THE PLATFORM DO SO AT THEIR OWN DISCRETION. ASSIGNED APPEARANCES CREATE A SEPARATE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PRINCIPAL ASSIGNING THE APPEARANCE AND THEIR PEER.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF THE SERVICES CONSTITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS. PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>1.   Acceptance</strong>
				The Terms, as amended from time to time and published at (apeer.co/terms), is a legal agreement between Apeer and you, enforceable like any written negotiated agreement signed by you. The Terms include and hereby incorporate by reference Apeer’s <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">By creating an account, accessing, or using the Services, you expressly acknowledge that you have read, understand, and accept the Terms. If you do not agree to any part of the Terms, do not access or use the Services.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">You are responsible for regularly reviewing the Terms as it may be modified at any time. All such modifications will be effective upon posting at (apeer.co/terms). If you are not satisfied with any update to the Terms, your sole remedy is to discontinue your use of the Services. Your continued use of the the Services after an update constitutes your acceptance of the update.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>2.   License</strong>
				Subject your compliance with these Terms, Apeer grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-commercial license for use on your personal device solely in connection with work you perform through the Services. All rights not specifically granted under this Agreement are reserved by Apeer and Apeer’s licensors. Your license confers no title or ownership in the App and should not be construed as a sale of any rights in the App. Apeer reserves the right to revoke this license for cause or breach of the Terms.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>3.   No Offer of Legal Services</strong>
				Apeer is not a law firm or lawyer referral service and does not practice law, give legal advice or make appearances in court. Apeer does not review any information you provide through the service for legal or factual accuracy or sufficiency, draw legal conclusions, or provide opinions about your case. Members who submit appearances and Peers who accept appearances do so entirely at their own discretion. Apart from offering, maintaining, and facilitating the operation of the platform, Apeer does not participate in the communication, interaction, or work performed by Members.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>4.   Eligibility</strong>
				YOU MUST BE A MEMBER IN GOOD STANDING OF YOUR RESPECTIVE STATE BAR TO USE THE SERVICE. By using the Services, you also represent and warrant that (a) you are 21 years of age or older; (b) you are legally able to enter into a contract; (c) you are a member in good standing with your respective state bar; (d) you are not subject to any legal disciplinary proceeding or any action alleging legal malpractice; (e) all information you submit to Apeer is truthful and accurate; (f) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; (g) you will not share your account with anyone else; and (h) your use of the Services conforms to the purpose of the Services, complies with these Terms, and does not violate any applicable law or regulation. If you do not meet the eligibility requirements set forth above, you may not use the Services or App.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>6.   Modification of Agreements Outside of the App</strong>
				Actions you take outside of the App can affect the terms and legal status of agreements you have created through the App. This can result in obligations, terms, or conditions not reflected in the App. For example, if you make an agreement with another Member through the App and later exchange communication modifying the agreement outside of the App, the resulting agreement may not be consistent with agreement delineated through the App.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">You acknowledge that removing the App from your device or otherwise deactivating your Apeer account does not terminate or otherwise affect the legal status of agreements you are party to or have offered through Apeer.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>7.   Intellectual Property Rights</strong>
				(A)    	Ownership. All title, ownership rights and intellectual property rights in and to the App (including but not limited to any patches and updates) and any and all copies thereof (including but not limited to any titles, computer code, themes, objects, catchphrases, locations, concepts, artwork, animation, sounds, musical compositions, audiovisual effects, methods of operation, moral rights, any related documentation, and “applets” incorporated into the Licensed Application) are owned by Apeer, affiliates of Apeer or Apeer’s licensors.  The Licensed Application is protected by the copyright laws of the United States, international copyright treaties and conventions and other laws.  You acknowledge that Apeer owns all rights in and to the App, including, but not limited to worldwide statutory and common law rights associated with (a) patents and patent applications; (b) works of authorship, including copyrights, copyright applications, copyright registrations and “moral rights;” (c) the protection of trade and industrial secrets and confidential information; (d) trademarks; and (e) divisions, continuations, renewals, derivative works, and re-issuances of any of the foregoing, now existing or acquired in the future.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">(B)    	Feedback. We may provide you with a mechanism to provide feedback, suggestions, and ideas on Apeer’s products and services. You grant us the irrevocable right to use your feedback and incorporate your suggestions into our products and services without any obligation to provide attribution or compensation to you or any third party.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>8.   No Incorporation of the Services or Licensed Application</strong>
				Including our products and services within any third party service is not permitted without our prior written consent.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>9.   Automatic Monitoring/Audits</strong></p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">(A)    	You acknowledge that Apeer reserves the right, at any time and without notice, to monitor compliance with the terms of this Agreement and to otherwise protect its rights in the Licensed Application by incorporating license management technology into the Licensed Application and monitoring usage, including, without limitation, time, date, access or other controls, counters, serial numbers, and/or other security devices.  The App may also include product activation and other security technology that is designed to prevent the unauthorized access, use and/or copying of the App, including any violations of this Agreement.  This technology may cause Your device to automatically connect to the Internet, may transmit information about you and the device used to access the App (including personal information) to Apeer, and may prevent uses of the App that are not authorized or permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">(B)    	Apeer reserves the right, with reasonable notice, to audit or have audited your use of the App to verify compliance with the terms of this Agreement.  Such audit shall be at Apeer’s expense unless noncompliance by you is found by the auditor, in which case, you shall reimburse Apeer for the reasonable costs of the audit in addition to payment of all fees necessary to obtain valid licenses to bring your use back into compliance.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>10.   Consent to Use of Data</strong>
				Your access and use of the App is not private or confidential.  Your access and use of the App is governed by Apeer’s <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> which is incorporated herein by this reference.  You agree that Apeer may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to the App.  Apeer may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>11.   Prohibited Uses</strong>
				You hereby acknowledge and agree that you shall not use the App for any purpose other than for non-commercial personal use, and that you shall use the App in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Except as expressly provided herein you shall not, and shall not permit any third party to:</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">a.         Exploit the App or any of its parts commercially. Notwithstanding, in certain circumstances Apeer may offer a separate license Agreement to permit you to make the Licensed Application available for commercial use.  If you seek such license, contact Apeer through the contact information below.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">b.         Use the App, or permit use of the App, on more than one device at the same time.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">c.          Make copies of the App or any part thereof, or make copies of the materials accompanying the App.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">d.         Copy the App onto a hard drive or other storage device except as specifically permitted herein.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">e.         Use the App, or permit use of the App, in a network, multi-user arrangement or remote access arrangement, including any online use, except as otherwise explicitly provided by the App.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">f.            Sell, rent, lease, license, distribute or otherwise transfer the App, or any copies of the App, without the express prior written consent of Apeer.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">g.         Reverse engineer, derive source code, modify, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works of the App, in whole or in part.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">h.         Remove, disable or circumvent any proprietary notices or labels contained on or within the App.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">i.             Hack or modify (or attempt to hack or modify) the App, or create, develop, modify, distribute or use any software programs, in order to gain (or allow others to gain) advantage of or access to the App in any online multiplayer game settings including but not limited to local area network or any other network play or on the Internet.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">j.             Export the App or any copy or adaptation in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>12.   Charges and Billing</strong>
				You agree that to the extent you provide Apeer and/or its licensors or affiliates any payment information, you represent that you are an authorized user of the chosen method of payment, and that all payment information you provide, including but not limited to your name, credit card or other payment account identifying number, expiration date, security codes, billing address, and any other payment information will be current, complete, true and accurate.  All expenses and costs incurred by you in connection with its activities hereunder, if any, are your sole responsibility.  You are not entitled to reimbursement from Apeer for any expenses, and you will hold Apeer harmless therefrom.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>13. Vetting</strong>
				Peers must meet certain requirements before they can receive, review, and/or accept appearances through Apeer. The vetting requirements include, but are not limited to, verification of identity, state bar history and status, and extent of experience within particular areas of law.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">Peer candidates may be asked to provide information such as work history that Apeer cannot confirm. Thus, Apeer cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of self-reported information. You should always exercise professional judgement and common sense when interacting with other Members, just as you would when interacting with other persons you do not know. </p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">APEER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF ANY MEMBER AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE APEER FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO. APEER WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE APEER PLATFORM.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>14. Fees, Disputes, and Refunds Between Members</strong>
				You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you (the “Fee”) for the services of a Peer. You will be advised of the Fee and asked to confirm before assigning an appearance through the Services. The Fee is subject to Apeer’s Cancellation Policy (apeer.co/cancellation).</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">After you have received services from a Peer through your use of the Service, Apeer will facilitate your payment of the applicable charges on behalf of the Peer. Apeer will charge the payment card you have added to your profile for this purpose. The Fee paid by you is final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Apeer. </p>
				After the Fee has been charged to your payment card you will receive a receipt from Apeer by email. <p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">If your payment card is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree to update your payment card so that Apeer may successfully complete the transaction and compensate your Peer accordingly.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">Apeer reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise the Fee for services obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Apeer’s sole discretion. Apeer may from time to time provide certain members with promotional offers that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services from a Peer at any time prior to the time of the assigned appearance, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee. This payment structure is intended to fully compensate Peers for the services provided. </p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">You acknowledge and agree that Apeer only facilitates the connection, communication, and payment between you and your Peer. Any and all substantive communication, services, and work relating to an appearance is between you and your Peer. Apeer cannot and does not make any representations or guarantees concerning the quality and/or nature of the services provided by Peers. Apeer may, in Apeer’s sole discretion, investigate any concern regarding an appearance and determine whether or not to issue a partial or full refund of a paid Fee.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">After you have received Services, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Peer. Any dispute regarding the quality and/or nature of Services provided by a Peer must be addressed directly between you and your Peer unless otherwise provided for under these Terms.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>15.   No Warranty</strong>
				Because Apeer is a do-it-yourself tool, the accuracy and sufficiency of agreements produced using Apeer ultimately depends on user input, which input Apeer does not review. Moreover, the law is a personal matter, and no general tool like Apeer is appropriate in every circumstance. Therefore, we don’t make any claims about quality, accuracy, legal sufficiency, legal enforceability, or appropriateness of Apeer for your needs. If you require legal advice or help on your specific situation, you should consult a licensed attorney in your area.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">Apeer offers no guarantees or warranties regarding the quality, dependability or competence of any User of Apeer.  Any User ratings or other information about Users that Apeer provides are offered solely for convenience of other Users and should not be relied upon as endorsements.  Apeer does not conduct any conflict of interest checks. Users bear sole responsibility to determine whether any Attorney provided through Apeer will be appropriate for their matter.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE APP IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION (“SERVICES”) ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND APEER HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  APEER DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN, OR SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY, THE LICENSED APPLICATION WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APEER OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE(S) SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">Any end-user questions, complaints or claims with respect to the Licensed Application should be directed to info@apeer.co.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">Apeer is responsible for providing any maintenance and support services with respect to the Licensed Application, as specified herein, or as required under applicable law.  You acknowledge that neither Apple nor any other party has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Licensed Application.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>16.   Limitation of Liability</strong>
				APEER DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS, INJURY, CLAIM OR DAMAGE RELATED TO YOUR USE OF ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE RESULTING FROM ERRORS OR OMISSIONS, A SITE OR APPLICATION BEING DOWN, OR DATA LOSS. APEER WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, RELIANCE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES ARISING FROM ANY COURT ACTION OR LEGAL DISPUTE.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">YOU HEREBY WAIVE THE PROTECTIONS OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE § 1542 WHICH SAYS: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>17.   Limitation on Damages</strong>
				ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE FILED WITHIN 1 YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OR ACTION AROSE REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTES OR LAW TO THE CONTRARY.  IN THE EVENT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION IS NOT FILED WITHIN SUCH 1 YEAR PERIOD, SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION IS FOREVER BARRED.  IN NO EVENT WILL APEER BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM POSSESSION, USE OR MALFUNCTION OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION, INCLUDING DAMAGES TO PROPERTY, LOSS OF GOODWILL, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES, EVEN IF APEER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  APEER’s LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE ACTUAL PRICE PAID FOR THE LICENSE TO USE THIS LICENSED APPLICATION. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION ARE A BARGAINED FOR EXCHANGE AND A MATERIAL CONDITION AND PREMISE OF THIS AGREEMENT.  SOME STATES/COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS AND/OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND/OR EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>18. Term &amp; Termination</strong>
				Unless terminated earlier as provided for herein, this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect for as long as you comply with this Agreement.  Without prejudice to any other rights of Apeer, this Agreement will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with its terms and conditions.  In such event, you must destroy all copies of the Licensed Application and all of its component parts.  Additionally, Apeer and/or its licensors, reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to or elements of the Licensed Application at any time without notice.  In no event will Apeer be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to the Licensed Application or any elements or portions thereof.  Apeer may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain elements or portions of the Licensed Application, in any case and without notice or liability.  You agree that Apeer shall not be liable for any loss or damage caused, directly or indirectly, by any such termination and/or suspension.  IN THE EVENT THAT YOUR ACCOUNT IS TERMINATED, YOU WILL HAVE NO FURTHER ACCESS TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY REFUND OR REIMBURSEMENT FOR ANY PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ACCOUNT</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>19.   Injunction</strong>
				Because Apeer would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, you agree that Apeer shall be entitled, without bond, other security or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as Apeer may otherwise have under applicable laws.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>20.   Indemnification</strong>
				You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apeer, its partners, affiliates, contractors, officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from all damages, losses and expenses arising directly or indirectly from your acts and omissions to act in using the Licensed Application pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>21.   Assignment</strong>
				Apeer may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time.  Notwithstanding, you may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under the Agreement and/or Licensed Application without Apeer’s express prior written consent.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>22.   Jurisdiction and Choice of Law</strong>
				This Agreement, and any disputes arising from or relating to the conduct covered by this Agreement, are governed by the laws of the State of California. You hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction, including waiving any objection to personal jurisdiction, of the courts of Los Angeles, California without regards to any principles of conflicts of laws and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Those who choose to access the Service and/or Licensed Application from locations outside of California do so on their own initiative contrary to the terms of this Agreement, and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>23.   Dispute Resolution</strong>
				A printed version of the Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You and Apeer agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Agreement and/or Licensed Application must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.  You agree that the provisions in this paragraph will survive any termination of your account(s) or the Agreement and/or Licensed Application.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">By your access to and use of the Agreement and/or Licensed Application you hereby specifically acknowledge, agree and consent that you waive your right to a trial, by jury or otherwise, and that you agree that any suit, action, proceeding, dispute, controversy or claim (“Dispute”) arising out of or relating to the Agreement, Licensed Application or any of the transactions contemplated herein or related to the Agreement and/or Licensed Application or any contests or services thereon (including without limitation, statutory, equitable or tort claims) will be dealt with in accordance with the following procedures.  All parties shall first attempt to negotiate all Disputes informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration.  Such informal negotiations shall commence following the receipt of a notice in writing by one of the parties sent to the other.  Apeer will send its notice to your billing address and email you a copy to the email address you have provided to us (if any).  You may send any notice to Apeer to the address listed below.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">If the Dispute is not resolved through informal negotiations the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.  If you are a resident of the United States, any arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, any arbitration shall be initiated in Los Angeles, California, using the English language in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in effect, by one arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of AAA arbitrators. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by an arbitrator rather than a court.  The prevailing party in any arbitration or other proceeding arising under this Agreement shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees and all other expenses) incurred in connection therewith.  Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.  Use of the Agreement and/or Licensed Application is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Agreement, including without limitation, this section.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">The parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between you and Apeer individually.  To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>24.   Miscellaneous</strong>
				This Agreement represents the complete agreement concerning this license between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between them.  It may be amended only by a writing executed by both parties.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected.  No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder will be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Any heading, caption, or section title contained herein is inserted only as a matter of convenience, and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof.
