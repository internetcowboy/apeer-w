				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you (the “Fee”) for the services of an appearance attorney (“Peer”). You will be advised of the Fee and asked to confirm before assigning an appearance through the Services. The Fee is subject to Apeer’s Cancellation Policy (apeer.co/cancellation).</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">After you have received services from a Peer through your use of the Service, Apeer will facilitate your payment of the applicable charges on behalf of the Peer. Apeer will charge the payment card you have added to your profile for this purpose. The Fee paid by you is final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Apeer. </p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">After the Fee has been charged to your payment card you will receive a receipt from Apeer by email. If your payment card is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree to update your payment card so that Apeer may successfully complete the transaction and compensate your Peer accordingly.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">Apeer reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise the Fee for services obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Apeer’s sole discretion. Apeer may from time to time provide certain members with promotional offers that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services from a Peer at any time prior to the time of the assigned appearance, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee. This payment structure is intended to fully compensate Peers for the services provided. </p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">You acknowledge and agree that Apeer only facilitates the connection, communication, and payment between you and your Peer. Any and all substantive communication, services, and work relating to an appearance is between you and your Peer. Apeer cannot and does not make any representations or guarantees concerning the quality and/or nature of the services provided by Peers. Apeer may, in Apeer’s sole discretion, investigate any concern regarding an appearance and determine whether or not to issue a partial or full refund of a paid Fee.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">After you have received services through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Peer. Any dispute regarding the quality and/or nature of services provided by a Peer must be addressed directly between you and your Peer unless otherwise provided for under these Terms.</p>

				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>14.                          NO WARRANTY</strong></p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">Because Apeer is a do-it-yourself tool, the accuracy and sufficiency of agreements produced using Apeer ultimately depends on user input, which input Apeer does not review. Moreover, the law is a personal matter, and no general tool like Apeer is appropriate in every circumstance. Therefore, we don’t make any claims about quality, accuracy, legal sufficiency, legal enforceability, or appropriateness of Apeer for your needs. If you require legal advice or help on your specific situation, you should consult a licensed attorney in your area.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">Apeer offers no guarantees or warranties regarding the quality, dependability or competence of any User of Apeer.  Any User ratings or other information about Users that Apeer provides are offered solely for convenience of other Users and should not be relied upon as endorsements.  Apeer does not conduct any conflict of interest checks. Users bear sole responsibility to determine whether any Attorney provided through Apeer will be appropriate for their matter.</p>

Those who choose to access the Service and/or Licensed Application from locations outside of California do so on their own initiative contrary to the terms of This Agreement, and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>22.                          DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">A printed version of the Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You and APEER agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Agreement and/or Licensed Application must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.  You agree that the provisions in this paragraph will survive any termination of your account(s) or the Agreement and/or Licensed Application.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">By your access to and use of the Agreement and/or Licensed Application you hereby specifically acknowledge, agree and consent that you waive your right to a trial, by jury or otherwise, and that you agree that any suit, action, proceeding, dispute, controversy or claim (“Dispute”) arising out of or relating to the Agreement, Licensed Application or any of the transactions contemplated herein or related to the Agreement and/or Licensed Application or any contests or services thereon (including without limitation, statutory, equitable or tort claims) will be dealt with in accordance with the following procedures.  All parties shall first attempt to negotiate all Disputes informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration.  Such informal negotiations shall commence following the receipt of a notice in writing by one of the parties sent to the other.  APEER will send its notice to your billing address and email you a copy to the email address you have provided to us (if any).  You may send any notice to APEER to the address listed below.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">If the Dispute is not resolved through informal negotiations the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.  If you are a resident of the United States, any arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, any arbitration shall be initiated in Los Angeles, California, using the English language in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in effect, by one arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of AAA arbitrators. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by an arbitrator rather than a court.  The prevailing party in any arbitration or other proceeding arising under this Agreement shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees and all other expenses) incurred in connection therewith.  Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.  Use of the Agreement and/or Licensed Application is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Agreement, including without limitation, this section.</p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">The parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between you and APEER individually.  To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
				 
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left"><strong>23.                          MISCELLANEOUS </strong></p>
				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">This Agreement represents the complete agreement concerning this license between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between them.  It may be amended only by a writing executed by both parties.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected.  No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder will be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Any heading, caption, or section title contained herein is inserted only as a matter of convenience, and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof. In addition to your obligations to pay APEER all amounts due under this Agreement,  Sections 3 (Ownership), 5 (Consent to Use of Data), 8 (Charges and Billing), 10 (Limitation on Damages), 14 (Indemnity), and 16 (Dispute Resolution) shall expressly survive termination of the Agreement. This Agreement shall be construed under California law as such law is applied to agreements between California residents entered into and to be performed within California, except as governed by federal law.  </p>

				<p class="featured-list-icon-text text-left">This Agreement is between you and APEER only, and not with Apple, and APEER, not Apple, is solely responsible for the Licensed Application and the content thereof.  You acknowledge that APEER, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any of your claims or any third party claims relating to the Licensed Application or your possession and/or use of the Licensed Application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Licensed Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.  In the event of any third party claim that the Licensed Application or the end-user’s possession and use of that Licensed Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, APEER, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.  You acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.</p>
