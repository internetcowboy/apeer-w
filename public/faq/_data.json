		"answer" : "1. REQUEST AND ASSIGN<br>An principal seeking coverage makes a request by submitting basic appearance details in-app. Once the principal has completed the request, reviewed the appearance fee, and confirmed, Apeer identifies the best available peers and and sends a notification. Peers are provided the information necessary to perform a conflicts check. The first peer to accept is then assigned the appearance and both attorneys are able to chat and share files through the app. <br><br>2. COMMUNICATE<br>The principal is responsible for providing the information and documentation necessary for the peer to successfully make the appearance. Likewise, the peer is responsible to prepare, arrive timely, and handle the matter professionally. <br><br>3. REVIEW<br>The peer submits a final report along with any related documentation on the same day as the appearance. The principal receives a receipt and their preferred payment method is automatically debited the appearance fee at that time. Both attorneys have the opportunity to indicate each other's performance to ensure the highest quality of service is maintained through Apeer."

(4) Lastly, if none of the other options suffice you may ask your peer for their email address and share the file by email. "
	},
	{
		"id" : "secure-and-ethics",
		"question" : "Is it secure and ethical to send confidential and privileged information through the app?",
		"answer" : "Yes, for two reasons:<br><li>The California Rules of Professional Conduct permits a lawyer to provide confidential  and privileged information to members of a lawyer’s staff who are involved in the client’s representation when made to further the client’s interests in a particular matter. An appearance attorney is considered a member of a lawyer’s staff for the scope of the appearance. (See, e.g., The State Bar of California Standing Committee on Professional Responsibility and Conduct Formal Opinion No. 2004-165)</li><li>Apeer encrypts all in-app communication. No one aside from yourself and your peer has access to it.</li>"
	},
	{
		"id" : "file-documents-pay-fees",
		"question" : "What if I need my peer to file documents with the court or pay fees?",
		"answer" : "Like any transaction between attorneys handling a matter together simply communicate your needs and provide them with the ability to deliver the results you desire.

Reports are guaranteed the same day as the appearance."
	},
	{
		"id" : "peer-principal-reviews",
		"question" : "Are there peer (and principal) reviews?",
		"answer" : "Yes. After an appearance is completed both attorneys rate each other's performance by tapping one of three options: “poor”, “good”, or “great”. There is also the opportunity to include additional feedback. Submitting a “poor” rating effectively initiates our dispute resolution process. Apeer Support will investigate the matter to determine what action, if any, is necessary to address concerns. To maintain trust and professionalism, only highly-rated attorneys are permitted to exchange appearances through Apeer."
	},
	{
		"id" : "records-after-completion",
		"question" : "What happens to my records after the appearance is completed?",
