	},
	{
		"question" : "How does Apeer work?",
		"answer" : "<b>1. ASSIGN</b><br>To request coverage a Principal taps “Assign” and submits the requested appearance details. Once the Principal reviews and approves the appearance cost, Apeer notifies qualified Peers and provides them the information necessary to perform a conflicts check (e.g. the identities of the client and opposing parties).  As soon as a Peer accepts the request the Principal is notified and the attorneys are connected.<br><br><b>2. CONNECT</b><br>The Principal is responsible for providing the information and documentation necessary for the Peer to successfully complete the appearance. Likewise, the Peer is responsible to prepare, present, and handle the matter professionally. Apeer provides all of the functionality you would expect - like chat and file sharing - in order to collaborate and complete the matter.<br><br><b>3. REVIEW</b><br>The Peer submits a summary report and any related documentation the day of the appearance. Thereafter, the Principal’s payment card is charged and the appearance is archived for future reference. Each attorney is asked to rate the other to ensure the highest quality of service across Apeer. "

	{
		"question" : "Can I assign an appearance on the same day as the hearing?",

	},
	{
		"question" : "What if an emergency prevents my Peer from making the appearance?",
		"answer" : "Peers are instructed to notify Apeer Support in an emergency. We will work diligently to replace them immediately.

	},
	{
		"question" : "What if there is an issue with my appearance?",

		"answer" : "Yes. After an appearance is completed each attorney rates the other by tapping one of three options: “poor”, “good”, or “great”.

Apeer Support will investigate the matter to determine what action, if any, is necessary to address concerns. An attorney who receives a rating of less than “good” is subject to removal from Apeer."
	},
	{
		"question" : "Can I access records from a past appearance?",
